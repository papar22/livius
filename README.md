# Livius video creator project

This repository contains a little but highly hackable tool for generating videos of conference talks.

In particular, it can run several passes for compensating for illumination changes, mix several sound
channels (speaker and room microphone), crop the slides, and more.

## Reference

The tool was used for generating the videos of the Machine Learning Summer School 2015 (TÃ¼bingen, Germany),
visible on YouTube.

## Documentation
